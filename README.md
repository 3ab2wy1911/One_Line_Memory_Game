# One_Line_Memory_Game
A game for Programming 1 Assignment at FCAI.

The game is a 2 players’ game in which:

	•	Each player enters 2 numbers.

	•	If the value of the first number equals the value of the second number the player gets a point.

	•	The game ends when there isn’t any number left.

This game is simple and hasn’t a graphical interface “until now”.
